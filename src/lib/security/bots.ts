/**
 * Good-faith crawler identification — shared by the edge proxy UA blocklist and
 * the geo-restriction gate.
 *
 * This list previously lived inside the edge proxy. It moved here because two
 * independent enforcement layers now need the same answer to "is this a
 * legitimate search/social crawler?":
 *
 *  1. The bad-bot 403 blocklist (never 403 a real crawler).
 *  2. The geo restriction (see `geo-restriction.ts`) — Googlebot and Bingbot
 *     crawl predominantly from **US** data centres. Geo-blocking them would
 *     silently de-index the entire site, so verified-by-UA crawlers are exempt.
 *
 * SECURITY NOTE: a User-Agent is trivially spoofable, so this exemption is a
 * deliberate trade-off. The downside of a spoofed UA is that one visitor sees
 * public marketing pages they were meant to be geo-fenced from — a marketing
 * concern. The downside of geo-blocking Googlebot is total loss of organic
 * search presence — a business-ending concern. Availability of *public* data
 * wins. Anything sensitive (admin, API mutations, auth) is protected by real
 * authentication and RLS, never by geography alone.
 *
 * Reverse-DNS crawler verification is the robust alternative but is not
 * available in the edge runtime (no DNS resolver). If stricter enforcement is
 * ever required, do it at the CDN layer (Cloudflare "Verified Bots").
