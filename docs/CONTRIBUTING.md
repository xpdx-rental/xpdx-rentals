# Contributing Guide

Welcome to the Cars365 engineering team. Follow these guidelines to maintain a clean, scalable, and secure codebase.

## Local Setup
See the `README.md` for standard local environment initialization.
Ensure you have `npm install` run and an `.env.local` populated.

## Branching & Commits
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/vendor-analytics`, `bugfix/search-latency`, `chore/dependency-updates`.
- Use standard Conventional Commits:
  - `feat: added bulk vehicle upload`
  - `fix: resolved race condition in lead creation`
  - `docs: updated api routes`

## Development Workflow
1. **Never write raw SQL queries in the Next.js app.** Always use the Supabase ORM interface.
2. **Always validate input.** Every API route and Server Action must parse incoming data using `zod`.
3. **Handle loading states.** For any async action, utilize React `useTransition` or `useActionState` to provide immediate user feedback.

## Pre-Pull Request Checklist
Before opening a PR to `master`, you must run and pass the following locally:
```bash
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
```

**Zero Warnings Policy:**
The codebase has been strictly audited to have zero unused variables and zero unused imports. A PR that introduces ESLint warnings will fail in Vercel CI and will not be merged.

## Continuous Integration
A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every pull request
and on pushes to `master`/`main`. The enforced **quality** job runs:
```bash
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run test
```
The production `build` job is opt-in (it needs Supabase env/secrets to render
pages). Enable it by setting the repo variable `RUN_BUILD=true` and providing the
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` secrets (plus the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` variable).

## Documentation Updates
If you add a new database table, update `docs/DATABASE.md`.
If you add a new public API endpoint, update `docs/API.md`.
If you change environment variables, update `.env.example`.
